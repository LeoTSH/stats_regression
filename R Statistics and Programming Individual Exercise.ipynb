    "\n",
    "Linear Regression is very useful for real-world machine learning. For example, we can use this algorithm to predict how far the disease of a diabetes patient has progressed one year after baseline. For this exercise, we are using a dataset collected from 442 people measuring 10 physiological characteristics such as age, sex and bmi. You can access the dataset from the aiap-workshop folder as `diabetes.tab.txt`"
